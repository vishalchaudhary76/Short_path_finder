# Short_path_finder

🧩 Python Maze Solver (BFS + curses)

This project is a Maze Solver in Python that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from a start (O) to an end (X) in a maze.
The solution is animated in the terminal using Python’s curses library.

🚀 Features

Finds the shortest path using BFS

Animated visualization in the terminal

Clean, modular code (easy to extend)

Simple to run — no external dependencies beyond Python

🛠️ Tech Stack

📖 How It Works

BFS explores neighbors level by level until the end (X) is found.

The path is highlighted in red as the algorithm progresses.

Final shortest path remains visible at the end.

🌟 Future Improvements

Add random maze generation

Implement other algorithms (DFS, Dijkstra, A*)

Step-by-step final path animation

GUI version with pygame
